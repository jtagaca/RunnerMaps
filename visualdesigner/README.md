## About
PathFinder is a graph visualizer that illustrates the process of determining the shortest path.
## Context
This was a personal project built with React.JS and deployed using Github Pages. The application enables users to visualize the path between two nodes; additionally, they can create an obstacle or wall to see whether the path remains feasible. I am implementing Dijkstra's algorithm for the path finding algorithm.
